# Rhumba üêç

¬°Caramba! R bindings for Mamba!

In early stages of development, but pretty usable.

## Installation

With either mamba or conda:

`mamba install rhumba`

`conda install rhumba`

## Use

You can use Mamba as your new package manager.

Set the channel you'd rather use:

`rhumba::set_channels(c("conda-forge", "default"))`

Try installing something:

`rhumba::install("xtensor")`

You might need to setup your `MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX` if you've never done it before.
You can do that by calling:

`rhumba::set_root_prefix(/path/to/prefix)`

Or use  micromamba shell init ... to initialize your shell, then restart. Check 
the use of micromamba [here](https://gist.github.com/wolfv/fe1ea521979973ab1d016d95a589dcde).
